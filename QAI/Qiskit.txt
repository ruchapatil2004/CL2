When working with Jupyter Notebook, you’ll need to create and use a new virtual environment specifically for Jupyter to avoid the mixed dependency issue with Qiskit. Here’s how you can set up a new environment and ensure that Jupyter uses it:

1. **Create a New Virtual Environment**:
   - In your terminal, create a new environment:
     ```bash
     python -m venv qiskit_env
     ```
   - Activate the environment:
     - On **Windows**:
       ```bash
       qiskit_env\Scripts\activate
       ```
     - On **MacOS/Linux**:
       ```bash
       source qiskit_env/bin/activate
       ```

2. **Install Qiskit and Jupyter**:
   - Install the latest Qiskit version:
     ```bash
     pip install qiskit
     ```
   - Install Jupyter Notebook within this environment:
     ```bash
     pip install notebook
     ```

3. **Add the New Environment to Jupyter Notebook**:
   - Install the IPython kernel for Jupyter:
     ```bash
     pip install ipykernel
     ```
   - Add the environment to Jupyter’s kernel list so it appears as an option when you open Jupyter:
     ```bash
     python -m ipykernel install --user --name=qiskit_env --display-name "Qiskit Env"
     ```

4. **Start Jupyter Notebook**:
   - Launch Jupyter Notebook from the same environment:
     ```bash
     jupyter notebook
     ```
   - When you open a new notebook, select the kernel named "Qiskit Env" (or whatever display name you used) from the **Kernel > Change Kernel** menu.

5. **Verify Installation**:
   - In the notebook, try importing Qiskit to confirm it’s working:
     ```python
     import qiskit
     print(qiskit.__version__)
     ```

6. **Clean Up Old Installations (Optional)**:
   - If you’ve installed Qiskit or `qiskit-terra` in the base environment or another conflicting environment, consider uninstalling them there to avoid future conflicts.

This should resolve the mixed dependency issue in Jupyter Notebook! For more information, refer to the [Qiskit packaging guide](https://qisk.it/packaging-1-0).
